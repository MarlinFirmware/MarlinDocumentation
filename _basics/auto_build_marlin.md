"*Auto Build Marlin*" is a *Visual Studio Code* extension that provides a one-button interface to build and upload Marlin Firmware to your selected `MOTHERBOARD`. This removes the need to edit your `platformio.ini` file or scroll through a long list of Marlin environments.

## Installation

- Click the "Extensions" button on the left of the *VSCode* window to show the **Extensions: Marketplace** panel.
- Type "Marlin" into the search box at the top.
- Locate **Auto Build Marlin** in the list and click **Install**. ([PlatformIO](/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html) will also be installed automatically.)

## Usage

- Launch *Visual Studio Code* and open up your downloaded *Marlin Firmware* project folder (***not the "Marlin" folder within it***). If you have the "PlaformIO Home" home tab open, you can use the **Import Projectâ€¦** button instead of the **Open** command.

- With Marlin open in *VSCode*, the "File Explorer" should be firmly rooted in your Marlin Firmware folder:

- Click the *Auto Build Marlin* icon ![AutoBuild Icon](/assets/images/basics/abm/icon.png) in the Activities Bar to bring up the *Auto Build Marlin* options bar.

- Click one of the tool icons to open the Auto Build Marlin panel and initiate a build, upload, etc. If there are multiple environments for your `MOTHERBOARD` you will be asked to choose one first.
