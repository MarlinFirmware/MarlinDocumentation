Before reading this article, you should have already read [Installing Marlin](install.html) and downloaded the Marlin source code. If you haven't done these steps yet, go [read that article](install.html), then follow the link back to this page to continue the process.

## PlatformIO

For the best build experience download *Visual Studio Code* and install the *PlatformIO IDE* extension. PlatformIO can also be installed as a stand alone CLI, which may be the best choice if you want to control the build process from a script on a server.

- [PlatformIO Command-Line](install_platformio_cli.html)

## Auto Build Marlin

The ([Auto Build Marlin](//marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarlinFirmware.auto-build)) extension provides a simplified interface to build and upload Marlin so that you don't ever need to know the name of the build environment for your board. See the [Auto Build Marlin](/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html) page for more details.
