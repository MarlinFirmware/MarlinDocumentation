## Technical details

The Marlin Documentation Project is built using the following technologies:

- [Ruby](//www.ruby-lang.org/)
- [RubyGems](//rubygems.org/)
- [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/)

## How to contribute

To work with the documentation, first [fork](//docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository to your GitHub account, then clone **your MarlinDocumentation fork** locally. You should do all work within your own fork before submitting it as a [Pull Request](//docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the `master` branch. You can download the [GitHub Desktop app](//github.com/apps/desktop) and use GitHub's "Open in Desktop" option, or from your own desktop, open a terminal/cmd window and do:

For example, change into the root of C:\\:

```bash
cd C:\
```

Clone Marlin Documentation repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDocumentation.git
```

This will create a local `C:\MarlinDocumentation` folder linked to your fork.

To add new documentation or edit existing documentation, start by [creating a new branch](//docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) as a copy of the `master` branch. You can do this using the GitHub web interface, from within GitHub Desktop, or from the command line.

If your new document is about "mashed potatoes" then name the new branch accordingly:

```
git checkout master -b doc-mashed_potatoes
```

Inside the `_docs` folder, add the new file `mashed-potatoes.md` and let flow all your creativity into it. When you feel your masterpiece is ready to be shared with the world, commit the changes and push them up to **your Marlin Documentation fork**. This is done most easily from within the GitHub Desktop app, but here are the command line commands for reference:

```sh
git add mashed-potatoes.md
git commit -m "Added a new document about potatoes"
git push
```

Next, start a new Pull Request to the upstream repository ([MarlinFirmware/MarlinDocumentation](//github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDocumentation)).

> [!TIP]
> Check out GitHub's documentation on [creating a new branch](//docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue), [managing branches](//docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository), and creating [Pull Requests](//docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) if you're new to contributing with git.

### Coding style

This Jekyll-based site is based on the [Markdown](//www.markdownguide.org/) language in delicious [YAML](//yaml.org/) wrapper. Be careful with this format because even small typos can cause Jekyll to reject the page. If you've installed Jekyll as described below, you can use it to build and preview the documentation and this will tell you where your errors are.

### Editorial style

Try to be neutral, concise, and straightforward. Avoid use of personal pronouns, unless avoiding them proves awkward. Provide images and give examples where needed. Check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation.

### Work in progress

You can use the `_tmp` folder for work-in-progress, and they will not be included in the site deployment.

## Local Jekyll preview

If you'd like to be able to preview your contributions before submitting them, you'll need to install Jekyll on your system. Instructions for Windows and macOS are given below:

### Installing Ruby on Windows

1. Download and install a Ruby+Devkit `3.3.4` from [RubyInstaller Download Archives](//rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/). Use default options for installation.

2. Run the `ridk install` step on the last stage of the installation wizard. Choose option `3` for `MSYS2 and MINGW development tool chain`. This is needed for installing gems with native extensions. You can find additional information regarding this in the [RubyInstaller Documentation](//github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2#using-the-installer-on-a-target-system).

> [!TIP]
> Once the `MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain` install is complete, the installation wizard will reprompt which components should be installed. If you see a "Install MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain succeeded" message above it, you can close the Command Prompt window and continue below.

3. Open a new Command Prompt so that changes to the `PATH` environment variable become effective, then check that everything is working:

   ```sh
   ruby -v
   ```
   If `ruby 3.3.4 (2024-07-09 revision be1089c8ec)` is reported, then proceed to [Set up the Marlin Documentation project](#set-up-marlin-documentation-project).

### Installing Ruby on macOS

> [!NOTE]
> Ruby may come preinstalled, but macOS' "system Ruby" is outdated, unmaintained, and not recommended for general use.
>
> There are many popular package managers for macOS, but we'll cover installation with [Homebrew](//brew.sh/) & [MacPorts](//www.macports.org/).

1. Install a package manager. You **do not** need to install both:

   - Install Homebrew by launching Terminal and running the following command:

      ```sh
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      ```

   - Install MacPorts by downloading & installing the correct package for your version of macOS from the [Installing MacPorts](//www.macports.org/install.php) page.

     - Either Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode are required to install packages with MacPorts. You **do not** need to install both. These are available for free on [Apple's Developer Program website](https://developer.apple.com/download/). An Apple Developer Program membership is not required, but you will need to sign in with your Apple ID.

2. Install `chruby` and `ruby-install`:

   - Homebrew:

     ```sh
     brew install chruby ruby-install
     ```

   - MacPorts:

     ```sh
     sudo port install chruby ruby-install
     ```

3. Install Ruby `3.3.4`:

   ```sh
   ruby-install ruby 3.3.4
   ```

   The configure, build, and install process will take a few minutes.

4. Configure your shell to automatically use `chruby`:

   - Homebrew:

     ```sh
     echo "" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "# Ruby Configuration" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "chruby ruby-3.3.4" >> ~/.zshrc
     ```

   - MacPorts:

     ```sh
     echo "" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "# Ruby Configuration" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "source ${prefix}/opt/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "source ${prefix}/opt/local/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
     echo "chruby ruby-3.3.4" >> ~/.zshrc
     ```

5. Quit and relaunch Terminal, then check that everything is working:

   ```sh
   ruby -v
   ```
   It should report `ruby 3.3.4 (2024-07-09 revision be1089c8ec)`. If not, repeat the above steps.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `ruby-install` you'll find your Ruby installations in `~/.rubies/` and you can switch between them with `chruby`. New instances of `zsh` in Terminal will default to 3.3.4 due to the changes made to `~/.zshrc`.

6. Proceed to [Set up the Marlin Documentation project](#set-up-marlin-documentation-project). (Note that `bundler` is already included.)

### Installing Ruby on Ubuntu

1. Ensure APT is up to date:

   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install prerequisites:

   ```sh
   sudo apt install git curl libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf bison build-essential libyaml-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
   ```

3. Install rbenv:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. Install Ruby 3.3.4:

   ```sh
   rbenv install 3.3.4
   rbenv global 3.3.4
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> When using `rbenv` you'll find your Ruby installations in `~/.rbenv/versions/` and you can switch between them with `rbenv global <version>`.

5. Check Ruby version:

   ```sh
   ruby -v
   ```
   It should report `ruby 3.3.4 (2024-07-09 revision be1089c8ec)`. If not, repeat the above steps.

6. Add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file to configure the gem installation path:

   ```sh
   echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

7. Install Bundler Gem:

   ```sh
   gem install bundler
   ```

8. Proceed to **Set up Marlin Documentation project**.

### Set up Marlin Documentation project

Once Ruby is installed, set up the Marlin Documentation project with Bundler. Open Command Prompt or Terminal and `cd` to the working path of **your Marlin Documentation fork**. Execute the following commands:

```sh
rm -f Gemfile.lock
bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
```

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to execute the above commands **once** to complete the install. If you see errors at this stage you may need to update your Ruby installation, fix your Ruby environment, or resolve dependencies between the Ruby gems.

### Jekyll basics

Jekyll uses a combination of YAML, Markdown, Liquid, and HTML to define the site content and layout. A `_config.yml` file defines a site structure with "collections" corresponding to sub-folders. The website is "compiled" to produce static HTML and Javascript. The most important folders in the site are:

- `_layouts` contains the general layouts (aka page templates).
- `_includes` has partial layouts included by others.
- `_meta` is where we keep top-level page descriptions.
- Sections: `_basics`, `_configuration`, `_development`, `_features`, `_gcode`, `_hardware`….

### Previewing content

To start a mini web server and preview your changes, run the following command:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --incremental
```

With the `serve --watch --incremental` parameters, Jekyll watches local files for changes and triggers an automatic incremental build of the site on every save. It also starts a mini-web server so documentation can be previewed in a browser at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000).

> [!TIP]
> The main Marlin repository comes with the [`mfdoc`](//github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.1.x/buildroot/share/git/mfdoc) script containing the commands above as a shortcut to preview the documentation.
