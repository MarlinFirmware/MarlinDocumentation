    RAMPS boards and derivatives can have a variety of layouts depending on where Heaters and Fans are connected.
    You can set `FET_ORDER_EEB` directly or let `pins.h` figure it out for you. These suffixed board names determine
    the Extruder / Bed / Fan assignments if `FET_ORDER_EEB` is not defined in the configuration.
