Laser features and other related options are enabled when `LASER_FEATURE` is defined in `Configuration_adv.h`.

If your spindle / laser accepts PWM signals for variable power levels enable the `SPINDLE_LASER_USE_PWM` option and define a `SPINDLE_LASER_PWM_PIN`. A hardware-enabled PWM pin will provide the best results. Otherwise the cutter will simply be turned on full for any non-zero value and off for zero.

### Power Modes

The default operating state for `LASER_FEATURE` is **Standard Mode**. In Standard Mode the `M3`/`M4`/`M5` commands wait synchronize the planner (causing a momentary stop) before changing the power. This mode is good enough for a spindle and is provided for backward compatibility. Standard Mode can be used in combination with `LASER_SYNCHRONOUS_M106_M107` (described below), and can be used to cut or to provide Spindle Feature operations when it is active.

There are two inline modes, selected using `M3`/`M4` with the `I` parameter. `M3 I` enables **Continuous Inline Mode** and `M4 I` selects **Dynamic Inline Mode**. These modes remain set `M5 I` returns to Standard Mode. In these modes, power set with the `S` parameter doesn't take effect right away, but applies on the next `G1`/`G2`/`G3`/`G5` move.

### Dynamic Inline Mode

Since Dynamic Inline Mode is new to Marlin (Oct 2021) it should still be considered under development and experimental. Dynamic Inline Mode scales laser power to the stepper feedrate so that a consistent amount of laser energy is applied to the workpiece throughout moves, even as they accelerate and decelerate. (It is similar to GRBL 1.1f in `M4` dynamic mode.) Stay tuned.

### Inline Mode

Since Marlin 2.0.9.x you'll get the best results using **Inline Mode** power control. Inline Mode applies power to a selected laser output pin defined by `SPINDLE_LASER_PWM_PIN`. This pin should be a hardware-enabled PWM output for optimal performance. If PWM hardware is available it is activated by defining `SPINDLE_LASER_USE_PWM`, providing a range of power levels. Without a PWM pin the cutter is simply turned on full for any non-zero value and off for zero. Power values are set when movement G-codes `G1`/`G2`/`G3`/`G5` are processed with an S-Value parameter such as `G1 X10 Y10 S100`. The inline power value is stored in the planner blocks so that laser power can be perfectly synchronized with every move.

### Motion Mode

The `GCODE_MOTION_MODES` option must be enabled for full compatibility with G-code generated by LaserGRBL and other laser / CNC software. This feature allows Marlin to process shorthand G-code moves that don't start with a `G#` command.

### Non-Inline Moves

While inline mode is active the `M3`/`M4`/`M5` G-codes are still processed and will wait for planner synchronization; they are then queued for the next move unless `LASER_POWER_SYNC` is enabled. The `LASER_POWER_SYNC` option allows any `M3`/`M4` G-code `S`-values to be enqueued, synced, and processed by the stepper ISR without pausing. Thus if no move is in progress the power is applied immediately.

### Trapizoid Power

While inline mode is active the trapizoid feature `LASER_POWER_TRAP` can be enabled. The `LASER_POWER_TRAP` option allows the laser power to be compensate during acceleration or deceleration of a move. It helps to reduce laser burning hot spots. It is important to note that if this feature is enabled on CO2 based lasers it may require that the `SPEED_POWER_MIN` option value is set. CO2 Lasers typically do not activate at very low PWM values. This feature will use the `SPEED_POWER_MIN` to ensure the laser power will not be below the minimum power activation value. The value is determined by testing incremental power values until the CO2 Laser fires.

### Laser on Fan Pin

In addition to inline mode we support laser synchronous fan mode set by defining `LASER_SYNCHRONOUS_M106_M107`. Laser synchronous fan mode uses G-codes `M106`/`M107` to set laser power on a fan output pin. This feature sets the laser power using planner "sync" blocks, which allow power to be set in perfect sync with movement. This mode works well, however inline mode is faster when performing raster image-based laser burns.

## Pins

Fan pin example:

Define pin 5 as the second fan just add this line to `Configuration.h`:
```cpp
#define FAN1_PIN 5 // 2nd fan output attached to laser TTL input
```
Example of G-code using `M106 P1`
```gcode
M106 P1 S0   ; Laser off (P1 = 2nd fan output)
M106 P1 S128 ; Laser at 50%
M106 P1 S255 ; Laser at 100%
```

#### Inline pin example:

Define pin 6 as the PWM pin and pin 4 as the ENABLE pin `Configuration_adv.h`.

These are the defaults for any RAMPS board and are already defined in `pins_RAMPS.h`. Override the default values by defining the desired values in `Configuration_adv.h`.
```cpp
#define SPINDLE_LASER_PWM_PIN 6 // Hardware PWM laser TTL input
#define SPINDLE_LASER_ENA_PIN 4 // CO2 PSU enable input
```

#### Example of G-code using `M3I`:
```gcode
M3 I S20       ; Enter Continuous Inline Mode and preload the next move power with S20
G1 X10 Y10     ; Move to X10 Y10 with S20 power
G1 X20 S50     ; Move to X20 with S50 power
M5             ; Kill the power and remain in Continous Inline Mode (M5 or M5I always waits for last move to complete)
```

It's fairly easy to select a pin for `SPINDLE_LASER_ENA_PIN`. Any unused digital pin with a 0 to 3.3V-5V logic level is sufficient.

It is _highly recommended_ to connect an external 1k-10k pullup resistor to the `SPINDLE_LASER_ENA_PIN`. This prevents the spindle/laser from powering on briefly during power-up or when the controller is reset (which happens whenever you connect or disconnect from most controllers).

Picking the PWM pin can be tricky. There are only 15 hardware PWM pins on an ATmega2560. Some are used by the system interrupts so are unavailable. Others are usually hardwired in the controller to functions you can't do without. Fans, servos, and some specialized functions all want to have a PWM pin. Usually you'll end up picking a function you can do without, commenting that function out (or not enabling it) and assigning its pin number to the speed pin. `PINS_DEBUGGING` and `M43` can be helpful to locate the best candidates.

For all CPUs the hardware PWMs on `TIMER1` are not available. Marlin uses `TIMER1` to generate interrupts and sets it up in such a way that the none of its PWMs can be used.

Servos also make hardware PWM(s) unavailable. In this case it's only the "A" PWM that's unavailable. The other hardware PWM(s) on that timer are available for general use.

## ATmega2560 PWM Assignments and Clients

Below is a table that can be used when selecting the speed pin on a 2560. (Other CPUs include a subset of the 2560 pins.)

There are 16 PWM ports assigned to 15 physical pins.

Pin 13 has two ports assigned to it. (`0A` and `1C`)

Timer + Port|Digital Pin|Normal Assignment|System Use|Optional Clients
TIMER3B|2|X_MAX||
TIMER3C|3|X_MIN||
TIMER0B|4|HEATER_4||
TIMER3A|5|HEATER_5||servo 0-11 ISR
TIMER4A|6|HEATER_6||servo 12-23 ISR
TIMER4B|7|LCD||
TIMER4C|8|HOTBED||
TIMER2B|9|HEATER_1||
TIMER2A|10|HEATER_0||
TIMER1A|11|HEATER_7|*stepper ISR|
TIMER1B|12|PS_ON_PIN|*stepper ISR|
TIMER0A|13|LED|LED PWM|
TIMER1C|13||*stepper ISR|
TIMER5C|44|LCD||stepper motor current XY PWM
TIMER5B|45|LCD||stepper motor current Z PWM
TIMER5A|46|Z_STEP||stepper motor current E PWM or servo 24-35 ISR

```
* These hardware PWMs are not available. The pin can still be used for general purpose digital I/O.
```
In addition to the above, fans can be assigned to PWM pins. If you pick a pin that's already assigned to a fan then you'll need to delete the fan or change its pin assignment. This is needed even if `FAN_FAST_PWM` is disabled.

**NOTE**: Most pins hardwired to a heater or fan are usually driven by a MOSFET with a pullup on its output through an LED to +12V/+24V. This will probably damage your spindle controller unless you add a protection circuit. If there isn't a +12V/+24V pullup you'll need an external 1k-10k pullup resistor to the pin.

# AT90USB646, 647, 1286 & 1287 PWM assignments

 - As with the atmega2560, the PWMs on Timer1 are not available.
 - These chips have 10 PWMs assigned to 9 pins. `TIMER0A` and `TIMER1C` are tied to the same pin. Most Arduino IDE extensions only make `TIMER1C` available (Teensyduino included).

# ATmega644 & 1284 PWM assignments

 - As with the 2560, the PWMs on Timer1 are not available.
 - All PWMs have their own pins.

#### Ammeter
Ammeter support, enables laser current monitoring on both 12864 & 2004 LCDs.
This is a low side configuration (Ground) current IC that can be used for both CO2 and Diode based lasers.
