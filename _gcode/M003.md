title: Spindle CW / Laser On
brief: Set the spindle CW speed or laser power
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
since: 1.1.2
requires: SPINDLE_LASER_ENABLE
related: [ M4, M5 ]
group: control

codes: [ M3 ]

long: Wait for moves to complete, then set the spindle speed (clockwise) or laser power.

notes: S is interpeted as the configured value range - either as PWM (default), Percentage or RPM (see `CUTTER_POWER_DISPLAY`).

parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Spindle speed or laser power in the configured value range (see `CUTTER_POWER_DISPLAY`) (PWM 0-255 value range by default)
    values:
      -
        tag: power
        type: byte
    
    tag: 0
    optional: true
    description: Spindle speed or laser power in PWM 0-255 value range
    values:
      -
        tag: power
        type: byte

examples:
  -
    pre: Set spindle rotation clockwise at 50% with `CUTTER_POWER_DISPLAY` set to `PERCENT`
    code: M3 S50
  -
    pre: Set spindle rotation clockwise at 6K RPM with `CUTTER_POWER_DISPLAY` set to `RPM`
    code: M3 S5000
  -
    pre: Set laser power to 50% in PWM
    code: M3 O128
  -
    pre: Turn on the laser at full / `SPEED_POWER_STARTUP` power
    code: M3
