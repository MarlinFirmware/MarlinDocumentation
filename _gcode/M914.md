title: TMC Bump Sensitivity
brief: Set sensorless homing sensitivity
author: thinkyhead,mbuc

experimental: false
requires: TMC2130,SENSORLESS_HOMING
group: control

codes:
  - M914

long: Some TMC stepper drivers can detect when they bump into something that causes them to stop moving. This feature is so sensitive that it can actually take the place of traditional endstops. Use this command to set the bump sensitivity for the X, Y, and Z stepper drivers.

notes:
  - Set `SENSORLESS_HOMING` in `Configuration_adv.h` to enable this feature.
  - This feature is currently only compatible with the TMC2130.
  - This works best with the `*_HOME_BUMP_MM` options set to 0.
  - Higher values = Lower sensitivity.

parameters:
  -
    tag: I
    optional: true
    description: (>=1.1.9) Index for dual steppers. Use `I1` for X2, Y2, and/or Z2.
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int
  -
    tag: X
    optional: true
    description: Sensitivity of the X stepper driver.
    values:
      -
        type: int
  -
    tag: Y
    optional: true
    description: Sensitivity of the Y stepper driver.
    values:
      -
        type: int
  -
    tag: Z
    optional: true
    description: Sensitivity of the Z stepper driver. 
    values:
      -
        type: int

Value Ranges:
    - TMC2208: from 0..255
    - TCM2130: from -64..+63
