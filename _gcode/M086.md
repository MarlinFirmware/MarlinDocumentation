Use this command to set a maximum period of time for the machine to be idle with heaters on. If the extruder temperature is above the trigger value and the machine is idle for longer than the set period, the firmware will set the temperature of all hotends and the heated bed to the configured temperatures.

Send `M86` with no parameters to report the current settings.
