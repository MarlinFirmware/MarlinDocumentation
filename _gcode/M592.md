Get or set Nonlinear Extrusion parameters.

When Nonlinear Extrusion is enabled the extrusion volume is adjusted (as a multiplier) based on the instantaneous extrusion velocity. The extrusion length is multiplied by `max(C, A * v^2 + B * v + C)` where `v` is extruder velocity in mm/s.

The adjustment only applies when…
- …performing a forward extrusion, since those are the ones affected by back-pressure.
- …another axis is also moving (i.e., it's not a simple unretract). This is to prevent blobs at the line start.
