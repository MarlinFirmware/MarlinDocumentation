`M413` is used to turn the **Power-loss Recovery** feature on and off. When Power-loss Recovery is enabled and Marlin is running a print job from the SD Card or Flash Drive, it periodically saves the print job state to the SD Card / Flash Drive. If the machine crashes or a power outage occurs, Marlin presents the option to resume the interrupted print job.

This feature is able to operate without a power-loss detection circuit by writing the recovery file periodically (_e.g.,_ once per layer). However, with a `POWER_LOSS_PIN` Marlin only writes the recovery info when a power-loss is actually detected. This method is preferred because the print will be resumed exactly where it was interrupted (rather than repeating the last layer), and the SD card or Flash Drive will incur much less wear.
