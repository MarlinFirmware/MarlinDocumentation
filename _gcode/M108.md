    The `M108` command requires `EMERGENCY_PARSER` for full effectiveness. (Otherwise a full queue blocks the parser.)

    Some G-Code commands cause Marlin to go into a closed loop, waiting indefinitely for a certain state or event. For example, `M109` waits for the target temperature to be reached, and `M0` waits for an LCD click.

    - In the case of `M109`, the `M108` command stops waiting for the target temperature and continues processing G-Code. This may result in "cold extrude" messages. For a full stop use `M112`.
    - In the case of `M0` the `M108` command acts like the LCD button, breaking out of `M0` and continuing to process the G-Code queue.

notes:
  - |
    With both `EMERGENCY_PARSER` and `HOST_KEEPALIVE_FEATURE` enabled, hosts will be able to prompt for continuation or cancellation, confirming with `M108` and cancelling with `M112`.

examples:

    pre:
      Use `M108` as a "Continue" button in your host software.
    code:
      - M0 You're up, mate ; in your G-Code file
      - M108               ; as your "Continue" button
