title: TMC Z axis calibration
brief: Align ends of the Z axis and test torque
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: HAVE_TMC2130,TMC_Z_CALIBRATION
group: control

codes:
  - M915

  The command aims to align the ends of the X gantry (for a Průša i3-style printer). Here's a [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqH41K2vq0g&t=300s).

  The current used should be close to the minimum that still allows the motors and the axis to move.
  A low current prevents unnessary forces applied to the frame and for the feature to work we intentionally want to lose steps at the end of the raise move.

  Using the given current, Marlin will move the Z axis (at homing speed) to the top plus a given extra distance. _This intentionally grinds the Z steppers._

  Z is then re-homed to correct the position.

notes:
  - Requires `TMC_Z_CALIBRATION` and at least one TMC driver for Z axis.
  - If `Z_DUAL_STEPPER_DRIVERS` is used, both should be TMC drivers.

parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: "Current value to use for the raise move. (Default: `CALIBRATION_CURRENT`)"
    values:
      -
        unit: mA
        type: int
  -
    tag: Z
    optional: true
    description: "Extra distance past `Z_MAX_POS` to move the Z axis. (Default: `CALIBRATION_EXTRA_HEIGHT`)"
    values:
      -
        unit: linear
        type: float

example:
  -
    pre: Set the current to 300mA and grind the steppers for 5mm.
