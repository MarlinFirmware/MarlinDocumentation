Use the [`M810`](/docs/gcode/M810-M819.html)-[`M819`](/docs/gcode/M810-M819.html) commands to set and execute 10 distinct G-code "macros." Put anything after the command to define its macro. To run the macro just send `M810`-`M819` by itself. Multiple commands in one macro are separated by the pipe character ('`|`').
