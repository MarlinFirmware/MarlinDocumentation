Marlin now contains support for SDCard alphabetical file sorting in the LCD menus. This feature uses free SRAM to create a sorting index for up to the first 256 files in the current folder, and (if you have _lots_ of SRAM) can optionally cache file listings for a more responsive UI. Buffering only occurs during file browsing. Otherwise the SRAM is freed.
