title: SDCard Sorting
brief: Set SDCard file sorting options.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: true
requires: SDSUPPORT
group: sdcard

codes:
  - M34

long:
  - One of Marlin's branches contains experimental support for SDCard file sorting in the LCD menus. This feature uses free SRAM to create a sorting index for the first 256 files in each folder, and can optionally cache file listings for a more responsive UI. Buffering only occurs during file browsing. Otherwise the SRAM is freed.

notes:
  - Requires [`SDSUPPORT`](/docs/configuration/configuration.html#sd-card) and `SDCARD_SORT_ALPHA`

parameters:
  -

      -
