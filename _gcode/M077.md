title: Stop Print Job Timer
brief: Stop the print job timer
author: thinkyhead

group: printjob

codes: [ M77 ]

notes:
- Marlin considers a print job to be in progress whenever the print job timer is running, so `M77` should be included in your ending G-code in your slicer settings.
- When `PRINTJOB_TIMER_AUTOSTART` is enabled the print job timer will be stopped in response to the heaters being turned off.
