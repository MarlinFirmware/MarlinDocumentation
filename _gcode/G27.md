title: Park the nozzle
brief: Moves the nozzle to a predefined position

experimental: true
since: 1.1.0-RC7
group: nozzle

codes:
  - G27

long:
  - "Allows the user to define a special XYZ position, inside the machine's topology, to park the nozzle when idle or when receiving the `G27` G-Code command."

notes:
  - 'Most of the default behavior is defined within `Configuration.h`, search for the option `NOZZLE_PARK_POINT`.'

parameters:
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: 'Z axis action'
    values:
      -
        tag: 0
        description: If current Z-pos is lower than Z-park then the nozzle will be raised to reach Z-park height
      -
        tag: 1
        description: No matter the current Z-pos, the nozzle will be raised/lowered to reach Z-park height
      -
        tag: 2
        description: The nozzle height will be raised by Z-park amount but never going over the machine's limit of `Z_MAX_POS`

examples:
  -
    pre:
      The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, this will default to a move the the parking position and raising the Z-pos if lower than the default Z-park position.
    code:
      - G27 ; raise Z if lower
  -
    pre:
      This one is useful to be used on the end-script of a print, it will raise the Z-pos by Z-park.
    code:
      - G27 P2 ; always raise Z
