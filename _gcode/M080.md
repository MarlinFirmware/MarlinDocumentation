notes:
  - A `PS_ON_PIN` is also required. Check your board's pins file for the default.
  - For Marlin 1.1.9 and earlier this feature is enabled by `POWER_SUPPLY`.
  - Some octoprint plugins filter out M80/M81. If M80 does not work, use a plain serial terminal first prior reporting a bug.

Turn on the high-voltage power supply. Requires a board that's powered from USB or another 5V source.
