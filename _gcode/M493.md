The Fixed-Time Motion Planner is an additional motion planning system provided by [Ulendo.io](//www.ulendo.io/) as an add-on to Marlin Firmware. It currently supports Cartesian and Core kinematics. It may be extended for Delta in the future. The `FT_MOTION` feature can be enabled at the same time as Marlin's integrated ZV Input Shaper, but these features do not share settings. It has its own implementation of Linear Advance (aka Pressure Advance) with its own gain parameter separate from [`M900`](/docs/gcode/M900.html).

One interesting feature of this add-on is that it can be enabled and disabled while the machine is running (and maybe even within a single print job). So if you prefer the integrated ZV Input Shaper for some prints and 2HEI Input Shaping for others you don't need to re-flash the firmware.

G-code `M493` allows you to enable or disable Fixed-Time Motion, change the current Input Shaper mode, and set parameters for its own Linear Advance and Input Shaping.

#### Input Shaper Tuning
It's not always easy to attach an accelerometer to most printer boards, so Marlin doesn't provide accelerator-based tuning. If you have that information you can use it. But the easiest way to tune Input Shaping is to print a ringing tower that goes through a range of frequencies, then examine the appearance of the ringing tower to choose the best frequencies for each axis.

##### 1. Get the Test Model
Download the [Ringing Tower STL](/assets/stl/ringing_tower.stl) which you will slice and use for the print test. For a CoreXY printer you should rotate the model 45 degrees, which isolates the A and B components of the motion system.

##### 2. Prepare the Slicer
Use a slicer that provides custom G-code macros for layer change. For example you can open [Kiri:Moto](//grid.space/kiri/) or download [Prusa Slicer](//www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424). If you use [Cura](//ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) you may need to install the Post Processing Plugin from the Cura Marketplace if it is not already installed.

- In the the Starting G-code enable Fixed-Time Motion with something like:
  ```
  M493 S11 D0 ; Enable ZVD Input Shaping
  ```

- In *Kiri:Moto* enable **Infill > Fill Type > Vase**. Then add the following under **Setup > Machine > Gcode Macros > Layer** to run a test range of 15Hz to 60Hz:

  ```
  M493 A{(layer < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer - 2) / 297)} ; (Hz) X Input Shaping Test
  M493 B{(layer < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer - 2) / 297)} ; (Hz) Y Input Shaping Test
  ```

- In *Prusa Slicer* you'll enable **Spiral vase**. Then add the following to your **Printer Settings > After layer change G-code** to run a test range of 15Hz to 60Hz:

  ```
  M493 A{(layer_num < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer_num - 2) / 297)} ; (Hz) X Input Shaping Test
  M493 B{(layer_num < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer_num - 2) / 297)} ; (Hz) Y Input Shaping Test
  ```

- In *Cura*, you'll first need to add the .py file in [this repository](//www.github.com/dsdanielko/cura-ringing-tower-script/) to your Cura "scripts" folder. Reopen Cura, enable **Spiralize Outer Contour** and set **Minimum Layer Time** to 0. Then go to **Extensions > Post Processing > Modify G-Code**. Click **Add a script** in the window that opens and use the dropdown menu to find **Input Shaping**. Make sure the **Motion planning type** dropdown is set to **M493**. The default frequency settings will let you test a range of 15Hz to 60Hz.

##### 3. Slice and Print
Slice and print the tower using 0.2mm layer height using the highest reasonable speed. When you examine the results it should be obvious where ringing is reduced the most on each axis. To get the Hz value for a given Z height, use the formula `15 + 45 * (z / 0.2 - 2) / 297`.

##### 4. Analyze the Result
Measure the height of the best looking layer, divide by the layer height, subtracting two layers. For example:
- The least X ringing appears at height 20mm. So we calculate `15 + 45 * (20 / 0.2 - 2) / 297` and get a result of 29.84Hz.
- Send the command `M493 A29.84` to apply the frequency to X motion. (For Y you would use `M493 B29.84`.)

#### More Resources
TH3D Studio has created an [Input Shaper Calculator](//www.th3dstudio.com/marlin-input-shaping-calculator/) that you can use to get the Slicer G-code you need and calculate the Hz value based on the best-looking layers.

#### Dynamic Shaping
Once you have the basic Input Shaping tuned, you may want to do further testing to see how the resonance changes as the Z height increases. Z height can affect the machine resonance whether the bed or the gantry moves in Z due to changes in the center of mass. Tuning according to the changing Z-height is more complicated than just printing a test model, and is best done with an accelerometer. Machine vendors should consider tuning at the factory and provide tuned profile settings for the popular slicers.
