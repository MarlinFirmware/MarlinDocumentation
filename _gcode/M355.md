title: Case Light Control
brief: Turn the case light on or off, set brightness
author: thinkyhead

requires: CASE_LIGHT_PIN
group: control

codes: [ M355 ]

notes: Requires a `CASE_LIGHT_PIN` to control the on/off or PWM state of the case light. The pin will need to be a 12V MOSFET pin with PWM control, or a signal pin connected to a MOSFET or relay to control the higher current required for the light.

parameters:
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Set the brightness factor from 0 to 255.
    values:
      -
        type: byte
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Turn the case light on or off.
    values:
      -
        type: bool


example:
  -
    pre: Turn the case light on at half brightness
    code: M355 S1 P128
