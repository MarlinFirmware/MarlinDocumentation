    Set acceleration overshoot for POLY6 (only used when `T=2`).
    Allowed range: 1.25 – 1.875. The higher the smoother the derivatives, but the higher the acceleration peaks.
    S_CURVE in the classic motion system uses 1.875

examples:
  - pre: |
      Set the trajectory generator to a 5‑th order polynomial (POLY5) s curve.
      Equivalent to POLY6 with 1.5 acceleration overshoot but cheaper to compute.
    code: M494 T1

  - pre: |
      Set the smoothing time for XYZ axes to 0.005s while leaving E unchanged.
    code: M494 X0.005 Y0.005 Z0.005

  - pre: |
      Configure the system for a trapezoidal trajectory generator, with a
      smoothing time of 0.10s on the X axis and 0.12s on the Y axis.
    code: M494 T0 X0.10 Y0.12

  - pre: |
      Use a 6‑th order polynomial (POLY6) with the maximum overshoot of 1.875,
      and set all axis smoothing times to 0.20s.
    code: M494 T2 O1.875 X0.20 Y0.20 Z0.20 E0.20

  - pre: |
      Only change the E‑axis smoothing time to 0.15s, leaving all other
      parameters at their defaults.
    code: M494 E0.15

  - pre: |
      Combine a POLY6 generator with an overshoot of 1.30 and individual
      smoothing times: X=0.05s, Y=0.07s, Z=0.06s, E=0.04s.
    code: M494 T2 O1.3 X0.05 Y0.07 Z0.06 E0.04

The `M494` command provides control over the Fixed‑Time Motion trajectory generator, allowing each axis to have its own timing characteristics.

The `T` parameter selects between three generator modes: a simple trapezoidal profile (0), a 5th‑order polynomial (1) that smooths acceleration and deceleration, or a more advanced 6th‑order polynomial (2) that includes an optional acceleration overshoot (`O`) to compensate for system inertia. When `T=2`, the overshoot value may be set between 1.25 and 1.875, giving the printer an additional degree of freedom to maintain speed while preventing jerk.

You can set smoothing times for each of the four motion axes (`X`, `Y`, `Z`, and extruder `E`). These parameters are expressed in seconds and determine how quickly the axis velocity can change, effectively acting as a low‑pass filter on acceleration commands. Adjust these values to balance responsiveness against mechanical wear, achieving smooth, precise motion for complex prints or high‑speed runs.
