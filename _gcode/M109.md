title: Wait for Hotend Temperature
brief: Wait for the hot end to reach its target.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
group: thermal

codes:
  - M109

long:
  - This command optionally sets a new target hot end temperature and waits for the target temperature to be reached before proceeding. If the temperature is set with `S` then `M109` waits *only when heating*. If the temperature is set with `R` then `M109` will also wait for the temperature to go down.

notes:
  - With `PRINTJOB_TIMER_AUTOSTART` this command will start the print job if heating, and stop the print job timer if the temperature is set at or below half of `EXTRUDE_MINTEMP`.
  - This command (and [`M190`](/docs/gcode/M190.html)) can block new commands from the host, preventing remote shutdown. However, if `EMERGENCY_PARSER` is enabled, a host can send `M108` to break out of the wait loop.
  - To set the hot end temperature and proceed without waiting, use [`M104`](/docs/gcode/M104.html).
