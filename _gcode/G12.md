title: Clean the Nozzle
brief: Executes a predefined nozzle clean pattern

experimental: true
since: 1.1.0-RC7
group: nozzle

codes:
  - G12

long:
  - Allows the user to start a nozzle cleaning process on demand by sending a G-Code command. Currently this command supports two different types of cleaning patterns, a stroke based one and a zig-zag like one. In order for this process to be effective is advisable to have a dedicated cleaning spot on the bed, or outside the bed but inside the reach of the nozzle.

notes:
  - 'Most of the default behavior is defined within `Configuration.h`, search for the options: `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_START_POINT`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_END_POINT` and `NOZZLE_CLEAN_PARK`.'
  - 'When `NOZZLE_CLEAN_PARK` is enabled, Marlin will automatically move the nozzle back to the XYZ position from where `G12` was initially received.'

examples:
  -
    pre:
      The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, this will default to a stroke based pattern which will be stroked `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES` times.
    code:
      - G12 ; stroke pattern (default)
  -
    pre:
      To generate a three triangle zig-zag pattern which will be stroked one time use the following command.
    code:
      - G12 P1 S1 T3 ; zig-zag pattern with three triangles
