tag: m0119
title: Endstop States
brief: Report endstop and probe states to the host.
author: thinkyhead

group: debug

codes: [ M119 ]

notes:
  - The `BLTOUCH` probe only sends a brief pulse, so "`TRIGGERED`" indicates the probe is in error state.
  - Similarly, Trinamic's Sensorless Homing only sends a short pulse, so for these "`TRIGGERED`" is unusual.

parameters:

example:
  -
    pre: Get all endstop states
    code: |
          > M119
          Reporting endstop status
          x_min: open
          y_min: open
          z_min: TRIGGERED
          z_probe: open
          filament: open

Use this command to get the current state of all endstops, useful for setup and troubleshooting. Endstops are reported as either "`open`" or "`TRIGGERED`".

The state of the Z probe and filament runout sensors are also reported with this command.
