title: Probe temperature calibration
brief: Calibrate probe temperature compensation
author: tompe-proj
contrib: thinkyhead

codes: [ G76 ]
related: [ M192, M871 ]

requires: PROBE_TEMP_COMPENSATION
experimental: true
group: calibration

notes:
  - Requires `PTC_PROBE` and `PTC_BED`.
  - This process can take a very long time. The timeout is currently set to 15min to allow the parts to fully heat up and cool down.
  - Use [`M500`](/docs/gcode/M500.html) to save the result to EEPROM.

    tag: B
    optional: true
    description: Calibrate bed only
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Calibrate probe only

example:
  -
    code:
      - G76 ; calibrate bed, then probe
      - G76 B ; calibrate bed only
      - G76 P ; calibrate probe only

Calibrate temperature compensation offsets for bed and/or probe temperatures. Temperature compensation values are added to probe measurements when running [`G29`](/docs/gcode/G029.html) mesh bed leveling. Currently, calibration only heats up the bed, not the hotend. The probe is heated up by bringing it close to the heated bed and cooled down by moving it away.

See [Probe Temperature Compensation](/docs/features/probe_temp_compensation.html) for a more detailed explanation of the process.
