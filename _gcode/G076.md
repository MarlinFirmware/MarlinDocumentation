title: Calibrate first layer temperature compensation
brief: Calibrate first layer temperature compensation
author: 

requires: PROBE_TEMP_COMPENSATION
experimental: true
group: features

codes:
  - G76

long: |
  Calibrate first layer temperature compensation values for bed and/or probe temperatures. Temperature compensation values will be added to probing measurements when running G29 mesh bed leveling. Calibration process only heats up bed, no hotend. Probe will be heated by bringing it close to the bed (probing point) and cooled down by moving it to a cool spot (coold down point). Find a more detailed explanation of the process in _features/probe_temp_compensation.md.

notes:
  - Requires `PROBE_TEMP_COMPENSATION`
  - Process might take some time as timeout is currently set to 15min to allow parts to heat up/cool down properly.
  - Use M500 to store values in EEPROM.

example:
  -
    code:
      - G76 ; calibrate bed, then probe
      - G76 B ; calibrate bed only
      - G76 P ; calibrate probe only
