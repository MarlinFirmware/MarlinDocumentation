title: Perform auto-calibration
brief: Uses a calibration cube, washer or bolt for automatic calibration
author: mteixeira

experimental: true
requires: CALIBRATION_GCODE
group: calibration

codes:
  - G425

long:
  - This performs an automatic calibration of backlash, positional errors and nozzle offset by touching the nozzle on the sides of a bed mounted, electrically conductive cube, washer or bolt.
  - Running calibration will measure backlash, but will not enable correction. Use [`M425`](/docs/gcode/M425.html) to do so.

notes:
  - Requires `CALIBRATION_GCODE` and the following parameters:
  - `CALIBRATION_MEASUREMENT_RESOLUTION` determines the increments taken in mm when performing measurements
  - `CALIBRATION_FEEDRATE_SLOW`, `CALIBRATION_FEEDRATE_FAST` and `CALIBRATION_FEEDRATE_TRAVEL` determine the speed of motion during the calibration.
  - `CALIBRATION_NOZZLE_TIP_HEIGHT` and `CALIBRATION_NOZZLE_OUTER_DIAMETER` refer to the conical part of the nozzle tip
  - `CALIBRATION_REPORTING` enables `G425 V` for reporting of measurements
  - `CALIBRATION_OBJECT_CENTER` and `CALIBRATION_OBJECT_DIMENSIONS` define the true location and dimensions of a cube/bolt/washer mounted on the bed.
  - `CALIBRATION_MEASURE_RIGHT`, `CALIBRATION_MEASURE_FRONT`, `CALIBRATION_MEASURE_LEFT` and `CALIBRATION_MEASURE_BACK` define the usuable touch points. Comment out any sides which are unreachable by the probe. For best results, all four sides should be reachable.
  - `CALIBRATION_PIN`, `CALIBRATION_PIN_INVERTING`, `CALIBRATION_PIN_PULLDOWN` and `CALIBRATION_PIN_PULLUP` configure the pin used for calibration. For example, if the nozzle is grounded, the calibation cube would be connected to a digital input pin with a pull-up enabled.

examples:
  -
    pre: Check the positional accuracy before calibration (requires `CALIBRATION_REPORTING`)
    code:
      - T1                  ; Switch to second nozzle
      - G425 V              ; Showing positional report for T1
      - T0                  ; Switch to second nozzle
      - G425 V              ; Showing positional report for T0
  -
    pre: Performs automatic calibration.
    code:
      - G425                ; Perform full calibration sequence
      - M425 F1 S0          ; Enable backlash compensation at 100%
  -
    pre: Check the positional accuracy after calibration (requires `CALIBRATION_REPORTING`)
    code:
      - T1                  ; Switch to second nozzle
      - G425 V              ; Validate by showing report for T1
      - T0                  ; Switch to second nozzle
      - G425 V              ; Validate by showing report for T0
