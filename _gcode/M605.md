title: Multi Nozzle Mode
brief: Set the behavior mode for a multiple nozzle setup
author: thinkyhead
contrib: pacocatech

requires: MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION|DUAL_X_CARRIAGE
group: control

codes: [ M605 ]

parameters:

- tag: S
  optional: false
  description: Select the pin to set for all specified axes.
  values:
  - tag: 0
    description: Full control mode. Both carriages are free to move, constrained by safe distance. (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
  - tag: 1
    description: Auto-park mode. One carriage parks while the other moves. (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
  - tag: 2
    description: Duplication mode. Carriages and extruders move in unison.
  - tag: 3
    description: Mirrored mode. The second extruder duplicates the motions of the first, but reversed in the X axis.

- tag: X
  optional: true
  description: X distance between dual X carriages.  (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
  values:
  - unit: linear
    type: float

- tag: R
  optional: true
  description: Temperature difference to apply to E1.  (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
  values:
  - unit: temp
    type: int

- tag: P
  optional: true
  description: Bit-mask of nozzles to include in the duplication set. 0 disables duplication. Bit 1 is E0, Bit 2 is E1 ... Bit n is E(n-1). (Requires `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`)
  values:
  - unit: mask
    type: int

- tag: E
  optional: true
  description: Last nozzle index to include in the duplication set. 0 disables duplication. (Requires `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`)
  values:
  - unit: index
    type: int

examples:

- pre: Set duplication mode
  code: M605 S2

- pre: Set duplication mode and configure extruders E0,E1 and E2 as active.
  code: M605 S2 E2

- pre: Set duplication mode and configure extruders E0 and E2 as active (This is bit pattern %101)
  code: M605 S2 P5

Set the behavior mode for multiple fixed nozzles such as a Dual Extruder or `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE` machine.

This command behaves differently for `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE` vs. `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`:
- For `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION` the `S2` parameter enables duplication mode. Any other value disables it.
- For `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`, this command sets the Dual X mode. See the description of `S` below.
- For Mirrored Mode: `M605 S2 R0 X<distance>` and `M605 S3`.
