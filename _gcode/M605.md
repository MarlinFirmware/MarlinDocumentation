parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: false
    description: Select the pin to set for all specified axes.
    values:
      -
        tag: 0
        description: Full control mode. Both carriages are free to move, constrained by safe distance. (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
      -
        tag: 1
        description: Auto-park mode. One carriage parks while the other moves. (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
      -
        tag: 2
        description: Duplication mode. Carriages and extruders move in unison.
      -
        tag: 3
        description: Mirrored mode. The second extruder duplicates the motions of the first, but reversed in the X axis.
  -
    tag: X
    optional: true
    description: X distance between dual X carriages.  (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
    values:
      -
        unit: linear
        type: float
  -
    tag: R
    optional: true
    description: Temperature difference to apply to E1.  (Requires `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`)
    values:
      -
        unit: temp
        type: int
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Bit-mask of nozzles to include in the duplication set. 0 disables duplication. Bit 1 is E0, Bit 2 is E1 ... Bit n is E(n-1). (Requires `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`)
    values:
      -
        unit: mask
        type: int
  -
    tag: E
    optional: true
    description: Last nozzle index to include in the duplication set. 0 disables duplication. (Requires `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`)
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int

examples:
  -
    pre: Set duplication mode
    code: M605 S2
  -
    pre: Set duplication mode and configure extruders E0,E1 and E2 as active.
    code: M605 S2 E2
  -
    pre: Set duplication mode and configure extruders E0 and E2 as active (This is bit pattern %101)
    code: M605 S2 P5

Set the behavior mode for multiple fixed nozzles such as a Dual Extruder or `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE` machine.

This command behaves differently for `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE` vs. `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION`:
- For `MULTI_NOZZLE_DUPLICATION` the `S2` parameter enables duplication mode. Any other value disables it.
- For `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`, this command sets the Dual X mode. See the description of `S` below.
- For Mirrored Mode: `M605 S2 R0 X<distance>` and `M605 S3`.
