      > M20
      Begin file list
      myfile.gco 14129
      subdir/moreth\~1.gco 68447

    code: |
      > M20 L
      Begin file list
      myfile.gco 14129 MyFile.gcode
      sub_di\~1/moreth\~1.gco 68447 Sub\ Directory/MoretHall.gcode
      End file list
      ok

List all printable files on the SD card back to the requesting serial port in compact DOS 8.3 format. Only files with `.gcode`, `.gco`, and `.g` extensions will be listed. Hidden files (beginning with `.`) will not be listed.

Hosts or serial controllers should send `M20` to get a DOS 8.3 file listing of the active media device that includes file sizes.

The file size is included in the output since Marlin 1.1.0.
