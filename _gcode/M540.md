title: Endstops Abort SD
brief: Abort SD printing when an endstop is triggered.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: SDSUPPORT,ABORT_ON_ENDSTOP_HIT_FEATURE_ENABLED
group: sdcard

codes:
  - M540

long: Set whether SD printing should abort in the event of any endstop being triggered. This provides a fast way to abort a print in the event of mechanical failure such as loose couplings, lost steps, diverted axes, binding, etc., which lead to axes being very far out of position.

notes:
  - Requires `SDSUPPORT` and `ABORT_ON_ENDSTOP_HIT_FEATURE_ENABLED`.
  - Use `ENDSTOPS_ALWAYS_ON_DEFAULT` or `M120` to ensure that endstops are enabled.
