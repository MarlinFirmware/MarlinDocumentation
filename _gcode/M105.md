tag: m0105
title: Report Temperatures
brief: Send a temperature report to the host.
author: thinkyhead

group: thermal

codes: [ M105 ]

notes:
  - Some hosts may hide the reply from [`M105`](/docs/gcode/M105.html).
  - A better way for hosts to get regular temperature updates is to use [`M155`](/docs/gcode/M155.html) (requires `AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES` and `EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT`). Hosts then no longer need to run an extra process or use up slots in the command buffer to receive temperatures.

parameters:
  -
    tag: T
    optional: true
    description: Hotend index
    values:
      -
        tag: index
        type: int
