examples:
  -
    pre: Rapid linear move to the machine origin in native space
    code: G53 G0 X0 Y0 Z0
  -
    pre: Rapid linear move to absolute coordinate X20 in native space
    code: G53 G1 X20
  -

[`G53`](/docs/gcode/G053.html) applies native workspace to the current move. See [`G54-G59.3`](/docs/gcode/G054-G059.html) for workspace coordinate system.
In CNC G-code [`G53`](/docs/gcode/G053.html) is a modifier. It precedes a movement command (or other modifiers) on the same line.
Marlin also accepts [`G53`](/docs/gcode/G053.html) on a line by itself as the command to return to the native workspace.
