  `G53` applies native workspace to the current move.
  In CNC G-code `G53` is a modifier. It precedes a movement command (or other modifiers) on the same line.
  Marlin also accepts `G53` on a line by itself as the command to return to the native workspace.

examples:
  -
    pre: Rapid linear move to the machine origin
    code: G53 G0 X0 Y0 Z0

    pre: Rapid linear move to absolute coordinate X20
    code: G53 G1 X20

    pre: Use native space
    code: G53
