`G53` applies the native workspace (aka Workspace 0) to the current move. See [`G54-G59.3`](/docs/gcode/G054-G059.html) for the commands used to select other workspace coordinate systems.

You can use `G53` as a modifier by putting it at the front of any standard movement C-code. See the examples below.

Marlin also accepts `G53` on a line by itself as the command to activate the native workspace.
