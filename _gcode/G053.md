title: Move in Machine Coordinates
brief: Apply native workspace to the current move.
author: shitcreek

requires: CNC_COORDINATE_SYSTEMS
experimental: false

codes:
  - G53

long: |
  `G53` applies native workspace to the current move.
  In CNC G-code `G53` is a modifier. It precedes a movement command (or other modifiers) on the same line.
  Marlin also accepts `G53` on a line by itself as the command to return to the native workspace.

notes:
  - Requires `CNC_Coordinate_Systems`

examples:
  -
    pre: Rapid linear move to the machine origin
    code: G53 G0 X0 Y0 Z0
  -
    pre: Rapid linear move to absolute coordinate X20
    code: G53 G1 X20
  -
    pre: Use native space
    code: G53
