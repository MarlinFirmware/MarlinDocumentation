`G53` applies native workspace to the current move. See [`G54-G59.3`](/docs/gcode/G054-G059.html) for workspace coordinate system.
In CNC G-code `G53` is a modifier. It precedes a movement command (or other modifiers) on the same line.
Marlin also accepts `G53` on a line by itself as the command to return to the native workspace.
