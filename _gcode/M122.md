requires: HAS_TRINAMIC_CONFIG
group: debug

codes: [ M122 ]

notes:
  - '`TMC_DEBUG` is no longer needed in Marlin 2.0.x, but enabling it produces an extended report.'
  - Responses of all `LOW` (`00:00:00:00`) or all `HIGH` (`FF:FF:FF:FF`) are signs of a communication problem.<br/>
    See [TMC Troubleshooting](/docs/hardware/tmc_drivers.html) for further information.

Do a communication check for configured TMC drivers. Trinamic drivers that support this feature are TMC2130, TMC2160, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2660, TMC5130, and TMC5160.

- With no parameters, this command returns the current settings for all installed and supported Trinamic stepper drivers.
- Send `M122 I` to re-initialize drivers after a late power-on. Use `S[0|1]` to enable/disable continuous debugging output.
