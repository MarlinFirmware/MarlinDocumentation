Set the Input Shaping damping factor and/or frequency (in Hertz) for axes that support it. Use `M593` with no parameters to report the current settings.

It's not always easy to attach an accelerometer to most printer boards, so Marlin doesn't provide accelerator-based tuning. If you have that information you can use it. But the easiest way to tune Input Shaping is to print a ringing tower that goes through a range of frequencies, then examine the appearance of the ringing tower to choose the best frequencies for each axis.

- Download the [Ringing Tower STL](/assets/stl/ringing_tower.stl) which you will slice and use for the print test. For a CoreXY printer you should rotate the model 45 degrees, which isolates the A and B components of the motion system.

- Use a slicer that provides custom G-code macros for layer change. For example you can open [Kiri:Moto](//grid.space/kiri/) or download [Prusa Slicer](//www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424).

- In Kiri:Moto enable **Infill > Fill Type > Vase**. Then add the following under **Setup > Machine > Gcode Macros > Layer** to run a test range of 15Hz to 60Hz:

  ```
  M593 F{(layer < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer - 2) / 297)} ; Hz Input Shaping Test
  ```

- In Prusa Slicer you'll enable **Spiral vase**. Then add the following to your **Printer Settings > After layer change G-code** to run a test range of 15Hz to 60Hz:

  ```
  M593 F{(layer_num < 2 ? 0 : 15 + 45.0 * (layer_num - 2) / 297)} ; Hz Input Shaping Test
  ```

- Slice and print the tower using 0.2mm layer height using the highest reasonable speed. When you examine the results it should be obvious where ringing is reduced the most on each axis. To get the Hz value for a given Z height, use the formula `15 + 45 * (z / 0.2 - 2) / 297`.

- Measure the height of the best result, divide by the layer height, subtracting two layers. For example:
  - The least X ringing appears at height 20mm. So we calculate `15 + 45 * (20 / 0.2 - 2) / 297` and get a result of 29.84Hz.
  - Set this value with `M593 X F29.84` then save with `M500` and it will apply to all motion from now on.

TH3D Studio has created an [Input Shaper Calculator](//www.th3dstudio.com/marlin-input-shaping-calculator/) that you can use to get the Slicer G-code you need and calculate the Hz value based on the best-looking layers.
