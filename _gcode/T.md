Use `T0`, `T1`, etc. to switch to the respective physical or virtual tool. See [Universal Tool Change Settings](/docs/configuration/configuration.html#universal-tool-change-settings) in `Configuration_adv.h` for more details.

In Marlin 2.1.3 and up you can use `T` with no tool number to report the current tool index to the serial console.

#### For MMU 2 (and Clones)
See the [MMU2 Special Commands](T-mmu2.html) page for information about special commands `T?`, `Tc`, and `Tx`.

For the MMU2 and clones the `T0`-`T7` commands select a new filament. After this command you must extrude at least 38.1 mm of filament at feedrate 19.02 mm/s to reach the extruder. (The distance to the extruder may differ for your particular machine.)
