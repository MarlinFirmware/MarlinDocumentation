With no parameter, report the current SD read position in the form "`SD printing byte 123/12345`." If no file is open the response is "`Not SD printing`."

With 'S<seconds>', set the SD status auto-report interval. (Requires `AUTO_REPORT_SD_STATUS`)

With 'C', get the currently open file's name (and long filename if possible). Print "`(no file)`" if no file is open.
