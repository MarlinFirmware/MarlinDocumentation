tag: m851
title: Z Probe Offset
brief: Set the Z probe Z offset from nozzle

experimental: false
requires: HAS_BED_PROBE
group: none

codes:
  - M851

long:
  - Set the vertical distance from the nozzle to the Z probe trigger-point.
  - |
    The easiest way to get the value is to:
    - Home the Z axis.
    - Raise Z and deploy the probe.
    - Move Z down slowly until the probe triggers.
    - Take the current Z value and negate it. (`5.2` => `-5.2`)
    - Set with `M851 Z-5.2` and `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.2`.

notes: The default (factory) value is set by `Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`.

parameters:
  -
    tag: Z
    optional: false
    description: Z probe Z offset
    values:
      -

        type: float

examples:
  -
    pre: Set a reasonable offset for an inductive probe
    code: M851 Z-2.0
  -
    pre: A probe that is triggered by the nozzle itself
    code: M851 Z1.2
