title: XYZ Probe Offset
brief: Set the Z probe XYZ offset from nozzle
author: thinkyhead

requires: HAS_BED_PROBE
group: none

codes: [ M851 ]

notes: |
      The default (factory) values are set by
        - (version 1.x)
          - `X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`
          - `Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`
          - `Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`

          Where the X and Y offsets must be integers.

        - (version 2.x)
          - `NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET`

        Positions:
        - X offset: -left  +right [of the nozzle]
        - Y offset: -front +behind [the nozzle]
        - Z offset: -below +above [the nozzle]

Set the XYZ distance from the nozzle to the probe trigger-point. These offsets are required for the firmware to know how to probe the bed and where probed points are in relation to the nozzle, and _vice-versa_.

The easiest way to get the Z offset value (assuming your homed Z = 0.0) is to:
  - Home the Z axis.
  - Raise Z and deploy the probe.
  - Move Z down slowly until the probe triggers.
  - Take the current Z position (as reported by [`M119`](/docs/gcode/M119.html)) and negate it. (`5.2` => `-5.2`)
  - Set with `M851 Z-5.2` and save it with [`M500`](/docs/gcode/M500.html).
  - Configure with `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.2`.

For the X and Y offsets you have to measure the distance with a ruler or caliper.

For LCDs that support MarlinUI you can enable `PROBE_OFFSET_WIZARD` and follow a guided process to set the probe Z offset.
