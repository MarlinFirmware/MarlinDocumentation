title: XYZ Probe Offset
brief: Set the Z probe XYZ offset from nozzle
author: thinkyhead

requires: HAS_BED_PROBE
group: none

codes: [ M851 ]

notes: |
  The default (factory) values are set by
  - (version 1.x)
    - `X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`
    - `Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`
    - `Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER`

    Where the X and Y offsets must be integers.

  - (version 2.x)
    - `NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET`

  X and Y offset:
    Use a caliper or ruler to measure the distance from the tip of
    the Nozzle to the center-point of the Probe in the X and Y axes.

  Z offset:
  - For the Z offset use your best known value and adjust at runtime.
  - Common probes trigger below the nozzle and have negative values for Z offset.
  - Probes triggering above the nozzle height are uncommon but do exist. When using probes such as this, carefully set `Z_CLEARANCE_DEPLOY_PROBE` and `Z_CLEARANCE_BETWEEN_PROBES` to avoid collisions during probing.

  Assuming the typical work area orientation:
  - Probe to RIGHT of the Nozzle has a Positive X offset
  - Probe to LEFT  of the Nozzle has a Negative X offset
  - Probe in BACK  of the Nozzle has a Positive Y offset
  - Probe in FRONT of the Nozzle has a Negative Y offset

  Some examples:
  - `#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 10, 10, -1 }   // Example "1"`
  - `#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET {-10,  5, -1 }   // Example "2"`
  - `#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET {  5, -5, -1 }   // Example "3"`
  - `#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET {-15,-10, -1 }   // Example "4"`

Set the XYZ distance from the nozzle to the probe trigger-point. These offsets are required for the firmware to know how to probe the bed and where probed points are in relation to the nozzle, and _vice-versa_.

The easiest way to get the Z offset value (assuming your homed Z = 0.0) is to:
  - Home the Z axis.
  - Raise Z and deploy the probe.
  - Move Z down slowly until the probe triggers.
  - Take the current Z position (as reported by [`M119`](/docs/gcode/M119.html)) and negate it. (`5.2` => `-5.2`)
  - Set with `M851 Z-5.2` and save it with [`M500`](/docs/gcode/M500.html).
  - Configure with `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.2`.

For the X and Y offsets you have to measure the distance with a ruler or caliper.

For LCDs that support MarlinUI you can enable `PROBE_OFFSET_WIZARD` and follow a guided process to set the probe Z offset.
