title: Direct Stepper Move
brief: Perform a direct, uninterpolated, and non-kinematic synchronized move
author: shitcreek
contrib: colinrgodsey

group: motion
experimental: true


codes: [ G6 ]

notes:
  - WARNING: Position sync in step-daemon is not entirely finished and movements made with the control panel may be lost. At this moment, homing is required to sync step daemon and the device. Always home before issuing movement commands. Use with extra caution.

Direct Stepping allows a host device to issue direct stepper movements that are defined in a binary format that is written ahead of time by the host device to a page in the device RAM.

The mechanism provided for loading the binary data onto the device is the "page manager". The page manager provided here uses a parallel protocol over the USB serial connection to write pages to the device RAM, and is decoupled from the normal serial g-code pipeline. This allows the host device to preload pages as fast as possible without waiting on the g-code pipeline.

Once a page is written by the device, it can be triggered using the G6 g-code which references the page index that should be used for that move. Depending on the page format, direction arguments may need to be provided in the G6 code.
