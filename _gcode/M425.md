title: Backlash compensation
brief: Enable and tune backlash compensation
author: mteixeira

experimental: true
requires: BACKLASH_COMPENSATION,BACKLASH_GCODE
group: calibration

codes:
  - M425

long:
  - Backlash compensation works by adding extra steps to one or more segments after a motor direction reversal.
  - By default, steps will be added to the first segment after a direction change, this gives the best dimensional accuracy but may cause marks to appear in the print. Smoothing spreads those extra steps multiple consecutive segments to prevent blemishes in the print, at the expense of dimensional accuracy.
  - Backlash compensation can be configured either at compile-time or run-time. Enable 'BACKLASH_GCODE' for run-time configuration, which enables `M425` as well as a "Backlash" menu in the LCD.
  - Backlash can automatically be measured on all axis by [`G425`](/docs/gcode/G425.html) or on Z only by [`G29`](/docs/gcode/G29.html) when `MEASURE_BACKLASH_WHEN_PROBING` is enabled.

notes:
  - Requires `BACKLASH_COMPENSATION`, `BACKLASH_GCODE` and the following parameters:
  - `BACKLASH_DISTANCE_MM` specifies the default backlash on the X, Y and Z axis.
  - `BACKLASH_CORRECTION`, specified the default backlash correction (0.0 = 0%, 1.0 = 100%)
  - `BACKLASH_SMOOTHING_MM` enables backlash smoothing over a specified distance
  - `BACKLASH_GCODE` enables `M425` for run-time tuning of backlash
  - `MEASURE_BACKLASH_WHEN_PROBING` causes the Z backlash to be measured when probing ([`G29`](/docs/gcode/G29.html))
  - `BACKLASH_MEASUREMENT_LIMIT`, `BACKLASH_MEASUREMENT_RESOLUTION` and `BACKLASH_MEASUREMENT_FEEDRATE` configure `G29` measurement.

examples:
  -
    pre: To manually configure backlash compensation
    code:
      - M425 X0.1 Y0.2 Z0.3 ; Set backlash to specific values for all axis
      - M425 F1             ; Enable backlash compensation at 100%
  -
    pre: Use smoothing for best print surface quality
    code:
      - M425 F1 S3
  -
    pre: Use no smoothing for best dimensional accuracy
    code:
      - M425 F1 S0
  -
    pre: To automatically measure X, Y, and Z backlash using `G425`:
    code:
      - G425                ; Perform a full calibration
      - M425 F1             ; Use full measured value of backlash on X, Y and Z
    post: G425 automatically loads the measured backlash into the backlash distance, but will not enable backlash compensation.
  -
    pre: To automatically measure Z backlash when probing with `MEASURE_BACKLASH_WHEN_PROBING`:
    code:
      - G29                 ; Perform probe and measure backlash on Z
      - M425 F1 Z           ; Use full measured value of backlash on Z
    post: `MEASURE_BACKLASH_WHEN_PROBING` measures backlash, but does not update the configured backlash distance. The measured value should be activated by using the `Z` argument without a value. This differs from the behavior of `G425`.
  -
    pre: To report the current backlash configuration:
    code:
      - M425
