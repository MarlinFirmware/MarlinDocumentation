title: Bed Leveling State
brief: Get and/or set bed leveling state and fade height
author: thinkyhead
contrib: sustmi, shitcreek

experimental: false
requires: AUTO_BED_LEVELING_(3POINT|LINEAR|BILINEAR|UBL)|MESH_BED_LEVELING
group: planner

codes:
  - M420

long:
  - Get and/or set the enabled state of bed leveling compensation, plus Z fade height.
  - This command has been extended with `L` to load a mesh for Unified Bed Leveling.

notes:
  - The "current position" may change in response to `M420 Sn`.
  - "`G28` disables bed leveling. Follow with `M420 S` to turn leveling on, or use `RESTORE_LEVELING_AFTER_G28` to automatically keep leveling on after `G28`."

    optional: true

                Leveling fade Z height (Requires `ENABLE_LEVELING_FADE_HEIGHT`)
                - While printing, gradually reduce leveling correction until the specified height is reached. <br /> At which point the movement will be level to the machine's XY plane as if bed leveling was disabled. 
                - When Z is not provided (eg `M420`) or is set to zero (eg `M420 Z0`), the leveling correction is fully applied at all heights.
