    pre: Halt if the MACHINE_NAME is not "Arthur"
    code: M16 Arthur

Do a case-sensitive comparison between the string argument and the configured `MACHINE_NAME`. If the machine name doesn't match, halt the printer so that a reset is required. This safety feature is meant to prevent G-code sliced for a specific machine from being used on any other machine.
