examples:
  -
    pre:
      The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, this will default to a move the the parking position and raising the Z-pos if lower than the default Z-park position.
    code:
      - G27 ; raise Z if lower
  -
    pre:
      This one is useful to be used on the end-script of a print, it will raise the Z-pos by Z-park.
    code:
      - G27 P2 ; always raise Z
