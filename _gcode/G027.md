        description: No Z raise. Just XY parking.

examples:
  -
    pre: The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, which raises Z by the default distance and moves to the parking position.
    code: G27 ; Raise Z if lower
  -
    pre: This one is useful as an end script, simply raising Z and parking.
    code: G27 P2 ; Always raise Z

Raise and park the nozzle according to a predefined XY position and Z raise (or minimum height) value.
