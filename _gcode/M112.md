notes: '[`M112`](/docs/gcode/M112.html) is the fastest way to shut down the machine using a host, but it may need to wait for a space to open up in the command queue. Enable `EMERGENCY_PARSER` for an instantaneous [`M112`](/docs/gcode/M112.html) command.'

Used for immediate halt, [`M112`](/docs/gcode/M112.html) shuts down the machine, turns off all the steppers and heaters, and if possible, turns off the power supply. A reset is required to return to operational mode.

`M112` is NOT a safety-rated "Emergency Stop" in the formal sense and is not guaranteed to meet the requirements of any safety category or required performance level (PLr). This is functionally a control stop. Machine builders should perform their own risk-assessment and implement suitable safety stop devices.
