title: Set Home Offsets
brief: Description Here

  - M206

long: |
  Use `M206` to apply a persistent offset to the native home position and coordinate space. This effectively shifts the coordinate space in the negative direction. See examples below.

  - The current position is adjusted to align to the new home offset values.
  - The home offset is persistent — added to the current position until changed.
  - Some uses include fine adjustment of Z position (without moving endstops) and shifting the coordinate space to print on a different part of the bed.

notes: |
  - Changing the home offsets will not invalidate bed leveling or other saved data.
  - View the current offsets with `M503`.
  - If `EEPROM_SETTINGS` is enabled, the home offsets are saved with `M500`, loaded with `M501`, and reset with `M502`.
  - [`M428`](M428.html) sets home offsets so the current position aligns to the native home position.
