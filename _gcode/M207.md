Use this command to set various parameters for firmware-based retraction. Send `M207` with no parameters to get the current firmware-based retraction settings.

### Retract/Recover tuning

A correct combination of 4 parameters is required for good tuning. This is tricky, but here are some helpful test patterns by JCZD that aim to use as little filament as possible:

![retract-recover helper](https://engrenage.ch/files/marlin_retract_recover_helper.png)

* [3x3x3x3 pattern](https://engrenage.ch/files/retract_recover_3x3x3x3-jczd.gcode) - 81 individual samples, you probably want to start with this and it should give you a decent approximation
* [4x4x4x4 pattern](https://engrenage.ch/files/retract_recover_3x3x3x3-jczd.gcode) - 256 individual samples, for fine-tuning

This has been tested with a 300x300mm bed but should mostly work on a 200x200mm bed. At the moment, there is no customizer tool, but you can use global search-and-replace. These G-code files **will not work** (on purpose) on your printer without modification, so follow the comments in the header and the first few G-code lines to customize for your machine and material. Happy calibrating!
