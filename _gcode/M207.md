Use this command to set various parameters for firmware-based retraction. Send `M207` with no parameters to get the current firmware-based retraction settings.

### Retract/Recover tuning

Typically one of these cases where the correct combination of 4 parameters is required for a good tuning. This is obviously tricky but JCZD wrote a test pattern to help with this while using a little filament as possible:

![retract-recover helper](https://engrenage.ch/files/marlin_retract_recover_helper.png)

* [3x3x3x3 pattern](https://engrenage.ch/files/retract_recover_3x3x3x3-jczd.gcode) - 81 individual samples, you probably want to start with this and it should give you a decent approximation
* [4x4x4x4 pattern](https://engrenage.ch/files/retract_recover_3x3x3x3-jczd.gcode) - 256 individual samples, for fine-tuning

My machine has a 300x300mm bed but it should mostly work on a 200x200mm bed. At the moment there is no tool available to customize, but it's easy enough with a global search-and-replace ; without modification these gcode files **will not work** (on purpose) on your printer, so you'll need to read the comments in the header and the first few lines so they fit your machine and material : if you've gotten as far as to read this line it shouldn't be too hard.
