title: STOP Restart
brief: Return the machine to Running state

experimental: false

codes:
  - M999

long: |
      If a **STOP** occurs you can use `M999` to restart the machine after resolving the issue.

      Marlin will call **STOP** if any error occurs that would make continuing the current process problematic. For example, if the probe fails to deploy, it will abort probing and STOP. This disables all heaters.
