If a **STOP** occurs you can use [`M999`](/docs/gcode/M999.html) to restart the "stopped" machine after resolving the issue.

Marlin will call **STOP** if any error occurs that would make continuing the current process problematic. For example, if the probe fails to deploy, it will abort probing and STOP. Note that this disables all heaters.
