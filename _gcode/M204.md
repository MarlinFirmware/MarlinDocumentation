title: Set Starting Acceleration
brief: Set the starting acceleration for moves by type.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
group: motion

codes: [ M204 ]

notes:
  - View the current setting with `M503`.
  - If `EEPROM_SETTINGS` is enabled, these are saved with `M500`, loaded with `M501`, and reset with `M502`.
  - Legacy `M204 S<accel>` is deprecated. Use separate paremeters `M204 P<accel> T<accel>` instead.

parameters:
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Printing acceleration. Used for moves that include extrusion (i.e., which employ the current tool).
    values:
      -
        tag: accel
        type: float
  -
    tag: R
    optional: true
    description: Retract acceleration. Used for extruder retraction moves.
    values:
      -
        tag: accel
        type: float
  -
    tag: T
    optional: true
    description: Travel acceleration. Used for moves that include no extrusion.
    values:
      -
        tag: accel
        type: float
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Legacy parameter for move acceleration. Set both printing and travel acceleration.
    values:
      -
        tag: accel
        type: float
