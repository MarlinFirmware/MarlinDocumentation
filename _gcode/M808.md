The Repeat Marker command is used to define regions of a G-code file that will be repeated during SD printing. A marker is first set with `M808 L[count]`, and later in the file a plain `M808` command is used count down and loop. (By default up to 10 start markers can be nested.)

In slicer software put `M808 L` to the "**Start G-code**" and `M808` to the "**End G-code**." But this command is not the only requirement. Before starting each whole object it's important to actually clear the print area of obstacles and to reset the coordinate system with `G92` or `G28`, so this command is best used with belt printers or other systems with automatic print removal.
