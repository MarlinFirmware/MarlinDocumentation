tag: m209
title: Set Auto Retract
brief: Enable / disable auto-retraction.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: FWRETRACT
group: planner

codes:
  - M209

long:
  - Enable or disable automatic retraction. This option is meant to help slicers that don't support `G10`/`G11`. But it can be used to override retraction in any GCode.
  - When auto-retract is enabled, all reversed E-only moves are treated as retraction. (Recover moves are also automatically overridden.) When disabled, E retraction derives from G-code.

notes:
  - Requires `FWRETRACT`.
  - Most slicers today can generate `G10`/`G11`. But this option is useful for older G-code.
  - Though not currently very popular, both volumetric extrusion and firmware-based retraction (and/or `M209`) make G-code more immune to changes from one machine to another, and permit changing the hardware without needing to re-slice.
  - See related codes [`G10`](/docs/gcode/G010.html), [`G11`](/docs/gcode/G010.html), [`M207`](/docs/gcode/M207.html), and [`M208`](/docs/gcode/M208.html).
