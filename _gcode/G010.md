Retract the filament according to settings of [`M207`](/docs/gcode/M207.html).

Firmware retraction allows you to tune retraction at the machine level and can significantly reduce the size of G-code files.

Multiple consecutive `G10` or `G10 S1` commands without a corresponding [`G11`](/docs/gcode/G011.html) or `G11 S1` will be ignored.

Performs two moves: a retract move at the retract feedrate/acceleration, and an optional Z lift at the maximum Z feedrate (travel acceleration).
