This command can be used to set the stepper inactivity timeout (`S`) or to disable one or more steppers (`X`,`Y`,`Z`, …, `E`).

If a timeout is given with `S`, this command just sets the stepper inactivity timeout, in seconds. Setting the timeout to 0 disables the timeout. This timeout duration applies to all axes configured to sleep with `DISABLE_IDLE_[AXIS]`.

If no timeout or steppers are given, this command immediately disables all steppers on all axes.

If any axes are specified, this command immediately disables all steppers on the specified axes.
