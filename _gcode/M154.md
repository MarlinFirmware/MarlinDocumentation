Some host software and serial controllers use `M114` to get the current position, but polling with [`M114`](/docs/gcode/M114.html) is less than optimal, and in older versions of Marlin it would cause print stuttering. With `M154` hosts can simply set an interval and Marlin will keep sending reports automatically. This method is preferred over polling with [`M114`](/docs/gcode/M114.html).
