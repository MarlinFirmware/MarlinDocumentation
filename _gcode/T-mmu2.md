For the MMU2 (and other Multi Material Unit clones) the `T0`-`T7` commands select a new filament. After this command you must extrude at least 38.1 mm of filament at feedrate 19.02 mm/s to reach the extruder. (The distance to the extruder may differ for your particular machine.)

#### Special Commands

- `T?` : (Requires `MMU2_MENUS`) Wait for target temperature, then load the filament all the way to the nozzle. G-code to extrude more is not needed.
- `Tx` : (Requires `MMU2_MENUS`) Load the filament up to the direct-drive extruder gears. No heating is required.
- `Tc` : Wait for target temperature, then load the filament from the extruder gears up to the nozzle. G-code to extrude more is not needed.
