Hosts shuld use `M110` to set the current line number as-needed during a host-controlled print job. The last `N` value found in the line will be applied. Each line number sent by the host must be one higher than the previous line number, or the firmware will ignore the line and send an error requesting a resend of the missing line. This is one technique Marlin uses to keep in sync with hosts.

Since Marlin 2.1.3 this command without parameters reports the last line number processed out of the host command queue.
