It can be useful for host software to track temperatures, display and graph them over time, but polling with [`M105`](/docs/gcode/M105.html) is less than optimal. With [`M155`](/docs/gcode/M155.html) hosts simply set an interval and Marlin will keep sending data automatically. This method is preferred over polling with [`M105`](/docs/gcode/M105.html).
