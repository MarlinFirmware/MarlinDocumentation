title: Set Hybrid Threshold Speed
brief: TMC driver switching to spreadCycle
author: mbuc

requires: TMC2130|TMC2208|TMC2209, HYBRID_THRESHOLD
group: control

codes: [ M913 ]

notes:
  - At least one parameter must be used.
  - Setting `X`, `Y`, `Z`, or `E` will set the hybrid threshold for all motors that fall under that category that have the `_IS_TRINAMIC` flag set. See examples below.

parameters:
  -
    tag: I
    optional: true
    since: 1.1.9
    description: Index for multiple steppers. (i.e., `I1` for X2, Y2, Z2; `I2` for Z3; `I3` for Z4).
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int
  -
    tag: T
    optional: true
    since: 1.1.9
    description: Index (tool) number for the E axis. If not specified, the E0 extruder.
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int
  -
    tag: X
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set Hybrid Threshold for X to the given value.
  -
    tag: Y
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set Hybrid Threshold for Y to the given value.
  -
    tag: Z
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set Hybrid Threshold for Z to the given value.
  -
    tag: E
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set Hybrid Threshold for E to the given value.

examples:
  -
    pre: Set Hybrid Threshold for X and X2 to 100…
    post: …assuming that X and X2 are both Trinamic drivers.
    code: M913 X100
  -
    pre: Hybrid Threshold for X and X2 are set to 100; Y is set to 120; E0 and E2 are set to 30…
    post: …assuming that X, X2, Y, E0, and E2 are all Trinamic drivers, but E1 is not.
    code: M913 X100 Y120 E30

When `HYBRID_THRESHOLD` is enabled, the TMC driver is switched from the quieter StealthChop to spreadCycle when the feed rate for a given stepper motor is over its `_HYBRID_THRESHOLD`.
