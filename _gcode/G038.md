    The Probe Target commands are used to probe towards a workpiece and determine its precise position. The Z endstop doubles as the probe for these commands. You might, for example, use a grounded metal workpiece, with a metal probe spliced into the Z endstop circuit.

    - `G38.2` probes towards a target and stops on contact, signaling an error if it reaches the target position without triggering the Z endstop.
    - `G38.3` probes towards a target and stops on contact. No error is given if it fails to trigger the Z endstop.

    These commands use the current homing feedrate, by default.

    These commands require `G38_PROBE_TARGET`.
