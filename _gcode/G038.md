The Probe Target commands are used to probe towards a workpiece and determine its precise position. You might, for example, use a grounded metal workpiece, with a metal probe spliced into the bed probe circuit.

- `G38.2` probes towards a target and stops on contact, signaling an error if it reaches the target position without triggering the probe.
- `G38.3` probes towards a target and stops on contact. No error is given if it fails to trigger the probe.

These commands use the current homing feedrate, by default.
