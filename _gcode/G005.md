notes:
  - It is an error if an axis other than `X` or `Y` is specified.
  - The first control point is the current position of the head. `XY` is the destination (the last control point of the spline).
  - The next control-points are the current position plus `IJ` and the current position plus `PQ`.
  - "`I` and `J` can be omitted, which results in these offsets being zero. This produces a 3-point spline (try the [interactive demo](//www.geogebra.org/m/WPHQ9rUt)). However, `P` and `Q` are required (otherwise you just get a linear movement)."

examples:
  -
    pre:
      - 'For example, to program a curvy "N" shape:'
    code:
      - G0 X0 Y0
      - G5 I0 J3 P0 Q-3 X1 Y1

  -
    pre:
      - 'A second curvy "N" that attaches smoothly to this one can now be made without specifying `I` and `J`:'
    code:
      - G5 P0 Q-3 X2 Y2

`G5` creates a cubic B-spline in the XY plane with the `X` and `Y` axes only. `P` and `Q` parameters are required. `I` and `J` are required for the first `G5` command in a series. For subsequent `G5` commands, either both `I` and `J` must be specified, or neither. If `I` and `J` are unspecified, the starting direction of the cubic will automatically match the ending direction of the previous cubic (as if `I` and `J` are the negation of the previous `P` and `Q`).
