There are many ways that RepRap enthusiasts, owners and builders of 3D printers, and sprightly startups can contribute to Marlin.

-   **Report Issues**
    The [Marlin Issue Queue] is the place to get help and make suggestions. The only way that bugs get fixed in Marlin is if we know about them, so don't hesitate to let us know if you have any problems. ***Please follow our [Bug Reporting Guidelines](reporting_bugs.html).***
-   **Become a Marlin Tester**
    To get the code tested as widely as possible we rely on volunteers with a wide variety of hardware configurations to test Marlin and help us to certify it as bug-free. If you'd like to help us test the latest code, please [tell us about your machine](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/1209)!
-   **Contribute Code**
    If you have reasonable skills with C++, Python, perl, or object-oriented Javascript then you have what it takes to write code for Marlin. The main codebase is written entirely in C++. Slicers and hosts that work with Marlin are typically coded in Python or perl. Web-based configuration tools are in high demand, so Javascript skills are a plus.
-   **Write Documentation**
    This Jekyll-based website -hosted using GitHub Pages- is now the central location for all Marlin documentation, and we're just getting started. If every Marlin user were to volunteer just a few minutes a day to help with this documentation, it would soon be complete. For not

#### Becoming a Developer

To get involved with the latest **cutting-edge development and testing on Version 1.2 and beyond**, make a fork of the [Marlin Development tree] and then go to the [Marlin Development Wiki] for guidance on the new file layout, obtaining the hardware support package, and integrating Marlin with Arduino >= 1.6.7.

Release versions of Marlin periodically exhibit bugs. While you can report a bug in the Issue Queue, if you have any coding skills you also have the option to contribute a patch based on your own fork. Minor releases will be made periodically integrating the best patches.
